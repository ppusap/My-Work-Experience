# TCS Chennai
I started working with TCS from 2016 in chennai,India. It's asia's largest IT park, which is totally madeup of steel.

I can summarize my whole journey in TCS into two parts. 
1. Training Period
1. Project Experience

## Training Period
Every fresher who are new to the IT industry have to undergo the training in TCS which is known as Initial Learning Program(ILP)period. It is a very intense training program in which associates were trained in different technologies based on their interest. I was trained in ASP.NET MVC framework. As I came from Electronics and Communication engineering background, those days were really challenging and equally exciting for me.

## Project Experience
I worked for MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, which is a leading hospitality company in the world. I worked as a backend developer for handling their reservation system. Every single day involves a lot of learning and lot of challenges. We used TPF(Transcation processing Facility)which is a IBM real time OS for Mainfram systems. It's a rare skilled technology but very effective for quick business transactions.
The following are my job responsibilites:
- "Responsible to ensure high availability, smooth operations and continuous improvements for the core capabilities of Application system"
- "Analysis, design, development, unit testing and deployment of application code related to assigned problem scenarios."
- "Developments related to performance improvements."
